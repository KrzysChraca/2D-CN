Purpose
What is the game’s purpose? Every game should be entertaining – but some of your games will also be educational (or maybe you’ll even put together an “advertainment” game). Discuss the purpose(s) of your game and how you expect the game will be used by the players.

Strategies
Discuss 3 strategies that players must use during the game to overcome the game’s challenges. Examples might be collecting, exploration, resource management, social interaction, direct vs stealth combat, hiding, quick reflexes, knowledge application (intrinsic or extrinsic), spatial navigation, pattern recognition, color matching, or quick reflexes.

Theory/Game Balance
What type of game theory elements are you using in the game? How are you maintaining game balance? Some examples might be transitive vs intransitive relationships, perfect vs imperfect information, Prisoner’s Dilemma or tragedy of the commons scenarios (cooperation/non zero sum games), dominant strategies, skill vs luck (randomness), and difficulty levels.

Art Style
What art styles or styles are used in the game? How do these choices contribute to the gameplay and the overall play experience? What are the challenges associated with the chosen art style? Provide some examples (images) from existing game or relevant media. Talk about characters, environment, and interface art styles.
